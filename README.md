# CALM-THE-CHAOS
AI-powered mental health support app prototype — personalized guidance and real-time emotional support.
# Overview

Calm the Chaos is an AI-assisted emotional wellness platform designed to offer support at the exact moment a user needs it. Instead of waiting for someone to reach out for help, the system quietly observes stress indicators and responds with personalized guidance — fully private, cross-device, and stigma-free.

# Problem We Address
